- question: What do you consider a digital product?
  answer: When we say digital product we are mainly talking about web, mobile and business apps. Depending on the project, youâ€™ll also need APIs and cloud services. If your project involves hardware and sensors, bring it on! We can chat about the details and see if we can help.
  
- question: What tools do you use to manage my project?
  answer:  We use Trello and Jira. We find these two work very well to assign and track tasks. We can chat about a system that is right for you.


- question: I already have a designer/developer, can you work together?
  answer: Yes. If you already have someone working on your product, we can coordinate and work together on your project.


  
- question: Do you guarantee that my project will be successful?
  answer: We guarantee that we will work on the agreed tasks and requirements and that we will deliver a product that works. Success not only depends on having a functioning product. Other factors such as marketing strategies, competitors, customer relationships and revenue streams play a decisive role.
