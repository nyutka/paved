  subtitle: What I do best is making complex things simple and creating technical solutions which bring value to businesses.
  description: >
      My passion for coding started in â€˜95 using a 486DX computer. Since then I have worked with a variety of technologies building multiple apps. Leading development of the products for our clients 
      I keep my feet on two grounds: latest technologies and people needs. Creating bespoke and custom business solutions requires juggling a variety of technologies- Java, PHP, JavaScript, Amazon Cloud Service, 
      databases and many more. However the most important part is establishing dialogue with you to understand your business objectives. This conversation allows to find a sweet spot where technology fits the best 
      with the organizational needs and thus provides the best value.
